I am currently pursuing PhD in [Mechanical Engineering](https://mane.rpi.edu/) at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/), Troy. I have done my MS in Mechanical Engineering from [University at Buffalo](http://www.buffalo.edu/), The State University of New York.  My field of interests include High Performance Computing, Finite Element Methods, Computational Solid Mechanics, crystal plasticity, numerical modeling of microstructure evolution of polycrystalline materials under thermomechanical loading.
