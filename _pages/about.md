# About Me

I am a PhD student in [Mechanical Engineering](https://mane.rpi.edu/) at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/), where I am working under the supervision of Prof. [Antoinette Maniatty](https://homepages.rpi.edu/~maniaa/) on computational modeling of microstructure evolution of polycrystalline material under thermo-mechanical loading using finite element crystal plasticity and Monte Carlo methods to simulate deformation and grain growth, respectively.

I received my MS from [University at Buffalo](http://www.buffalo.edu/), The State University of New York and B.Tech from [Vellore Institute of Technology](https://vit.ac.in/), both in Mechanical Engineering as well. My field of interests include High Performance Computing, Finite Element Methods, Computational Solid Mechanics, and crystal plasticity.
