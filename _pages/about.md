I am currently pursuing PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Troy. I have done my MS in Mechanical Engineering from University at Buffalo, The State University of New York.  My field of interests include Finite Element Methods, Computational Solid Mechanics, Computational Fluid Dynamics, High Performance Computing, Combustion and Emissions.

I am deeply intrigued by the phenomena that control the physical world and how the findings can be used to improve the performance of our designs and control the impact they have on the environment. I have worked on numerous projects in the field of  High Performance Computing, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Finite Element Analysis, CAD modeling and Analysis, Heat transfer, IC Engine performance improvement and testing.

In my free time, I like to paint.
