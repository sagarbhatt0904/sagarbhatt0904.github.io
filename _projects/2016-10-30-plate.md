This project aims at studying the deformation of a thin plate with a central circular hole when the plate is loaded in tension with a constant load. Finite element codes were developed in MATLAB using constant strain triangle elements, four- and eight-noded isoparametric elements. A convergence study was performed based on the energy norm a for all three cases and the stress concentration factor around the circular hole was also investigated.The computed results were then compared with the results obtained using commercial code ABAQUS.
