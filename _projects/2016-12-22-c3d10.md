The aim of this project is to develop a code to perform finite element analysis of a three-dimensional isotropic elastostatic body by developing an eight-node linear isoparametric hexahedral element. The code was developed using MATLAB and analysis was performed on a cantilever rectangular beam and an I-beam. The results were compared with the results obtained from ABAQUS to verify the accuracy of the solution. The deflections were plotted for both problems based on the results obtained from the code as well as ABAQUS. The code was also used to study the error in energy norm for the rectangular beam.
